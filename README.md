# WebParts for LibrePCB

A search tool that finds datasheets, footprints, and schematics across different web EDA vendors and imports them into LibrePCB libraries

# Project Goals

The overall project goal is that a Web based library > search > copy to local > review footprints/schematics can be "the Library" workflow that solves a lot of the commentary about not enough components being available in the standard libraries of LibrePCB

Serve as a companion to LibrePCB to make finding parts easier.
In LibrePCB's forums and in GitHub issues, the opinion seems to be that there's no easy, automatic way to get a reliable online parts catalog.
Library conversion is hard, and professional PCB designers already usually have to review online-sourced footprints. Compounding the issue is that different EDAs and PCB design softwares follow different conventions for how they label things in a schematic.

# Vision

A PySide6 and Qt6 user interface written in Python and packaged as a single .exe/binary that searches online for electronic components and finds schematics, footprints, 3D models and datasheets.

Converts from different web EDA vendors' footprint languages into LibrePCB s-expressions primitives.
Inspired by https://github.com/uPesy/easyeda2kicad.py and https://github.com/dbrgn/svg2librepcb
Creates/finds a local library on the user's computer in the directory of their choosing and add "their" EasyEDA components searched in the UI to the local library

Desired web search endpoints:

- [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com/) and [LCSC](https://www.lcsc.com/)
- SnapEDA
- Partstack
- Digikey
- Mouser

Once a part is found, WebParts gives you a workflow to review the accuracy of the symbols.
The addition of Footprint images in a recent LibrePCB release is a foundation for this review workflow

In the long term it would be nice to have this feature integrated in LibrePCB. There are at present 2 options for where the library search and conversions ought to be done:

1. _Locally_ like the existing Eagle/KiCad importers (then it should be written in Rust or C++)
2. _Server-Side_ on the LibrePCB API server: because it relies on API access of 3rd part web searches like EasyEDA which could theoretically break at any time. On the server, part search could be vendor-agnostic in the server API. Have a "LibrePCB parts search" that uses the API endpoint listed in Settings (so that if someone really wanted to roll another compatible API server they could) and extend the existing "parts" https://github.com/LibrePCB/librepcb-api-server/blob/master/app.py#L261 call to also be able to send footprints/symbols.

Then, the workflow UI tool is focused on search > results review > copy part into local library > review symbols for accuracy

# Future

An extension of this could be: after an individual reviews the footprint and "approves" it, then keep a count of "approved" footprints that gets sent back to the server for a "confidence score" of how good the part is in the server library.

# Usage

It is recommended to have [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed,
otherwise just run the scripts with `python` instead of `uv run` and
install dependencies manually.
